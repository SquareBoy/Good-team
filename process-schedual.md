The ongoing work includes two parts: one is to redesign the leaflet based on the existing leaflet, and the other is to try a new form of data presentation - data comics to illustrate the interview process and relevant data.

As for the design of leaflet, our draft layout is as follows (including information of four parts, see the headline in the figure). And some other survey results will be displayed in the draft diagram later.
First, we are thinking about an interactive pie graph including the following information:

1) the type of crime
2) facts about violent crime
3) different kinds of property crime
4) the percentage of crimes reported

And some other information will also be included:

1) the change of objective crime rate over years
2) people’s perception of police
3) people’s perception of crime (local crime/national crime)

In terms of data comic, we drew a rough comic strip form by hand(surely it is quite rough now), and later it will included more graphs of data. Basically, it would be similar to the following data comic:
