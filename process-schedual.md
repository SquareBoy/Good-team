The ongoing work includes two parts: one is to redesign the leaflet based on the existing leaflet, and the other is to try a new form of data presentation - data comics to illustrate the interview process and relevant data.

As for the design of leaflet, our draft layout is as follows (including information of four parts, see the headline in the figure). And some other survey results will be displayed in the draft diagram later.
First, we are thinking about an interactive pie graph including the following information:

1) the type of crime
2) facts about violent crime
3) different kinds of property crime
4) the percentage of crimes reported

And some other information will also be included:

1) the change of objective crime rate over years
2) people’s perception of police
3) people’s perception of crime (local crime/national crime)

In terms of data comic, we drew a rough comic strip form by hand( it is quite rough now), and later it will included more graphs of data. Basically, it would be similar to the following data comic:

- finish our final vision for presentation and feedback，see other documents（leaflet and datacomics）
- prepare  presentation

## 2018/12/05
- final report


## Short-term plan（Needed to be completed during the Christmas holidays）

- keep the design style of leaflets consistent with the style used in SCJS reports so that those who receive the leaflets and reports can understand both easily.
- Change the manifestation of some data. For example, in the previous version, our understanding of the deprived area is one-sided.
- Consider more about the factors of government background while making the data comics and setting the characters (pending to discuss with our data holder).
- Carefully check if there is any other problem in the visualisation before it can be used (e.g. whether there are errors in expressions and data, whether it reflects inequality).
