# DATA VISUALIZATION FOR SCJS


### What is SCJS?
The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey(SCJS) is a large-scale social survey which asks people about their experiences and perceptions of crime. The survey is important because it provides a picture of crime in Scotland, including crimes that havenâ€™t been reported to, or recorded by the police and captured in police recorded crime statistics.
